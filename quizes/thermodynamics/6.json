        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "For substances like water vapor that have strong intermolecular forces, the ideal gas law often overestimates the specific volume (or underestimates the density) because it does not account for the attractive forces that pull molecules closer together. This would result in Z < 1."
