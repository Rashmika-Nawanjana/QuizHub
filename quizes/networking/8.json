      "They are permanently connected",

      "They amplify signals"

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "In a crossbar switch, crosspoints can be turned on or off to establish or break connections, allowing different input-output combinations for space-division switching."

    "options": [
      "Output runs at the same speed as input",
      "Output runs N times as fast as input for N input lines",
      "Output runs slower than input",
      "Speed relationship varies randomly"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "In time-division multiplexing, the output runs N times as fast as the input when there are N input lines, allowing all inputs to be accommodated in the single output stream."

    "options": [
      "Computers communicate too slowly",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Circuit switching is inefficient for computer communications because computer traffic is typically bursty with long idle periods, yet the circuit remains allocated and paid for during these idle times."

    "options": [
      "Use of headers",

      "Use of intermediate nodes",
      "Store-and-forward operation"

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The key distinguishing characteristic is that in packet switching, data is divided into smaller units called packets, while in message switching, entire complete messages are transmitted."

    "explanation": "The main benefit of labels is simplified and faster switching in core nodes, as switches only need to look at the short label rather than processing complex destination addresses."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Very long messages can hog buffer space at intermediate nodes and hog the links between them, potentially causing delays and resource starvation for other messages."

    "options": [
      "All packets follow the same predetermined path",

    "explanation": "In datagram networks, each packet is independently routed based on its destination address, with routing decisions made at each intermediate node."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The header in packet switching provides control information necessary for routing and handling the packet, including destination addresses and other control fields needed for proper delivery."
